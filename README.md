# script-for-source-solidity-code

This is a simple script that can run with node.js to quickly fetch the source solidity code of a contract. To use it, you need to:
1. Install node.js;
2. install axios; npm install axios
3. Get your free etherscan API.

Also note:
1. This only works on verified contracts.
2. This is for ETH mainnet. If you want to use it for other EVM chains, change the API_KEY and URL accordingly.
